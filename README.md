## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

Using these utility code, i can use background-image and the others utility with much more easier.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code + Tailwind CSS utility I'm proud of</h1>
```

```html
<body class="bg-patternTopMobile bg-no-repeat lg:ml-0 lg:h-screen lg:bg-patternBottomDesktop lg:bg-right-bottom">
  <section class="sm:mx-auto sm:w-96 lg:mx-0 lg:w-full lg:bg-patternTopDesktop lg:bg-no-repeat"></section>
</body>
```

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwind css and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
